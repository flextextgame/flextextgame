"""
Objective: Beat the CPU (Computer) in either of the three random number
generator game. Wins and loss for each game are accumulated.

RPS: Rock, Paper, Scissor | Select either of the three choices

        Win conditions:
        Rock > Scissor
        Paper > Rock
        Scissor > Paper

Dice: Roll the dice (only get to choose the amount of sides the dice has)

        Win condition: Get a higher value than the CPU

Cards: Select a card from the shuffled deck

        Win condition: Get a higher value than the CPU

        Card to Number defitnion:
        Ace = 1
        Jack = 11
        Queen = 12
