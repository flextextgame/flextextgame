# Title: Flex-Text game

"""
Objective: Beat the CPU (Computer) in either of the three random number
generator game. Wins and loss for each game are accumulated.
RPS: Rock, Paper, Scissor | Select either of the three choices
        Win conditions:
        Rock > Scissor
        Paper > Rock
        Scissor > Paper
Dice: Roll the dice (only get to choose the amount of sides the dice has)
        Win condition: Get a higher value than the CPU
Cards: Select a card from the shuffled deck
        Win condition: Get a higher value than the CPU
        Card to Number defitnion:
        Ace = 1
        Jack = 11
        Queen = 12
        King = 13
Note: every "print('\n')" is creating extra blank lines to space out texts
